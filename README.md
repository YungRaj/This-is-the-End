# This is the End
This is a SpriteKit game that is like Mario. It contains a custom character with multiple guns and many alien, robot and other enemies. There’s store included in the app, but it is not completed yet and fully integrated with Apple’s internet services (GameKit, iAP, etc). The Settings and Help menu have not been completed yet and no, this app hasn’t been implemented with Auto-Layout but it works on all iPhone displays (will have to refactor images and code for iPad support). AI is not complete yet but all the controls, platforms, physics and collision detection have been fully implemented. Art has been completed by Parker Graham (twitter: @yungbasedparker). 

Completion rate: 70%
